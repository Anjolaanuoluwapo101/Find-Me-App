# Find-Me-App
A Droidscript application that makes tracking of people possible.Backend built using PHP

The Server Side Directory should be hosted and requires atleast PHP >= 7.4
##NOTE:
(If you're hosting the server side,you will need to modify the HTTPHOST constant in 'Find Me App.js' (http://localhost:8000) is what's present,so running it locally won't pose any issue)
Also,
The app is built with droidscript.(A JavaScript Framework)

The apk folder consists of the the .apk file which can be directly installed on any device and also the .spk file which can be imported into a Droidscript IDE and modified.
The keystore file in that directory what was used in signing the already present apk.
